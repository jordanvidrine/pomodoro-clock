## Pomodoro Timer
Work in progress inspired by [Free Code Camp's Front End Libraries Projects - Build a Pomodoro Clock](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock)

### Specs
1. User must know whether they are 'Working' or on 'Break'
2. User must be able to set Session and Break length
3. Session-Length <= 25 && Break-Length <= 10 && Neither < 1
4. Session-Count <= 10
5. Timer Must reach 0 before switching
6. Beeper must sound when timer reaches 0

#### Current Issues
1. Sound doesnt work on mobile
2. Need to edit "Finished" componenent render
